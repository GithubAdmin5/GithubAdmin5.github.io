### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    One of my favorite labs was Lab 1, despite it being quite simple to code, especially when compared to other labs that we did, it helped me with many things. It helped me understand that computer science is not an easy course, as throughout the lab my group and I were struggling with technical difficulties. But as a result, we learned that being thorough was important in order to succeed and that even if the task at hand may seem easy, make sure to be prepared and open-minded. 

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 part 2 was my favorite lab this semester. The game of blackjack is my favorite card game, and being able to create my own working version was very fun and exciting to me. What I liked the most about the lab was the complexity, It allowed me to attain a deeper understanding of both how code is influenced by every little aspect, and the game of blackjack as well.

* Lab 5

    Another lab that I enjoyed was Lab 5 part 1, where our goal was to use the command line to aid in the creation of a Mad Lib game. This lab really helped me understand that computers are very good at following patterns, experiencing this definitely helped me complete the lab. Another reason I liked this lab was because of the game itself, it was very fun to experiment with the code to make different Mad Libs.
